              <h2>Greg's Carpentry And Remodeling</h2>

              <p>
                Greg runs a carpentry and remodeling business in the Salt Lake
                City UT area. He does great work and has the reviews to back it
                up.
              </p>

              <p>
                I discovered Gregs business while browsing the service section
                on a classified site. I noticed that he didn't have a website
                and so I reached out offering to make him one
              </p>

              <p>
                After some going back and fourth I got an idea of more or less
                what he was looking for and got to work. Gregs website features
                some of his work, and reviews from clietns. I am pretty happy
                with how it all turned out, and hopping it works out for him. So
                if you're in the Salt Lake City UT area and need some carpentry
                and remodeling done, check out Gregs website
              </p>

                "the website that they built was amazing the website was nice
                looking cool mechanics. I would give this a 5 Stars if you need
                a website to here NOW!" -Chase The Potato
              </p>

              <p>
                Chase The Potato is a small gaming youtuber. I built this site
                for him so that he could have an extra touch point with his
                audience, as well as establish himself as a more professional
                looking profile.
              </p>

              <p>
                Giving this website a more gamer like aesthetic was important to
                me as it is a core part of Chase The Potatoes brand. To do this
                I made the opening of his site the picture he uses for his
                Youtube as well as his name to create a feel reminiscent of
                discord. Additionally I kept the colors mostly to black white
                and gray similar to platforms like steam and epic games
              </p>

              <p>
                Overall I think it is a nifty little single page application
                that does a good job of showing off his brand.
              </p>
